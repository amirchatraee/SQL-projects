# SQL-projects

These are samples of SQL projects that are related to the production side of the business, mostly about the quality checking of products as well as the transition steps for a product from the entry check to reaching the customers. Different types of techniques have been used in order to optimize the SQL codes such as different types of joins and conditioning as well as aggregation functions.
